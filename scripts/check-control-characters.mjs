/**
 * Fails if any tracked text file contains a raw control or invisible character.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Twice during development a literal control character reached a source file
 * where an escape sequence was intended - a NUL inside a string that should
 * have read backslash-u-0-0-0-0. Nothing caught it:
 *
 *   - the tests still passed, because the assertion was written against the
 *     same literal character and stayed consistent with it;
 *   - the typechecker was happy, because a NUL in a string literal is valid
 *     TypeScript;
 *   - git silently reclassified the file as binary, so it produced no diff and
 *     could not be reviewed.
 *
 * A test suite cannot catch this class of bug on its own: the bug and its
 * assertion agree with each other. The file has to be inspected as bytes, which
 * is what this does.
 *
 * It matters more here than in most projects. This library is about the sweep -
 * the substitution of exactly the characters that render as nothing - so its
 * sources are full of deliberate references to them. Every one of those must be
 * an escape sequence a human can read in a diff, never the character itself.
 *
 * Allowed: tab, newline, and carriage return as the first half of a CRLF pair,
 * so a Windows checkout with core.autocrlf=true passes.
 *
 * Note that the ranges below are written as numbers rather than as a regular
 * expression literal. A character class spelled with the characters themselves
 * would make this file the first thing it has to reject.
